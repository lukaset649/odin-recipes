        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My kids love these chocolate chip pancakes that are light and fluffy and loaded with gooey chocolate. You can also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top once the pancakes are on the griddle instead of folding them into the batter — that way you can adjust the amount of chocolate chips per pancake.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the buttermilk: Combine milk and vinegar in a bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to sour the milk.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Whisk egg, butter, and vanilla extract into buttermilk mixture until well combined; add flour mixture and whisk until just combined. Fold in chocolate chips. The pancake batter will be thick. Allow batter to rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat, and coat with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Pour about ¼ cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 2 to 4 minutes. Flip pancake with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 more minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
